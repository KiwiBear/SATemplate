<b>Bugs</b>

AI “Join My Squad”>transported>“Leave Squad”>”Join My Squad”>positioned>”Leave Squad” - squad members run away or get in a helicopter and sit so they cannot be re-recruited.  Happened while recruiting a bunch of AI, dropping them at FOB and disbanding. Then flying back and getting more AI and moving them to the FOB and disbanding.  Problem occurs after the first group is recruited and released a second time. (Chewie)  SEE: https://youtu.be/KyFp94xJixQ
AI numerous times are moved from my squad position back to base or at least distance from me. Especially when vehicle is hit with them in. (reported by Thomas)

Mohawk exploding when pilot get in it out in field. (reported by Thomas + Chewie)

Couple times can't find the command radio. Not marked on map. (reported by Thomas)
  Couldn’t find it when it was dropped 2nd time

SL lost SL position w/o dying even though they were in position #1 (reported by Thomas)

<b>New Feature Ideas:</b>

Move Chute functions to the top of  the scroll list for HALO jumping so space-bar will deploy main and reserve.  *note also “Cut Chute” as right cntrl can result in accidentally cutting your chute while trying to enable GPS while in parachute glide w/ r-cntrl+m (Chewie)

Squad teleport to port (SA Created)

Earplugs; making it easier to hear coms over vehicle and gunfire noise. (Chewie)  -simplest example I have seen elsewhere I THINK is basically a mapped key [del] that toggles the games sfx volume down a certain % and puts a little message on screen saying “Your Earplugs are In/Out”.  More advanced examples I have seen involve actually having to have the earplugs in your inventory to use it.

Towing (ie: re-positioning a plane on the runway because they don’t reverse, moving H-Barriers on the ground) (Chewie)

Helo Fuel/Engine damage - A reasonable way to recover a helicopter that has taken engine damage and lost all of its fuel; examples range from a slower drain rate, jerry cans/barrels, a smaller fuel truck or some kind of portable fueling 
system,etc. (Chewie)
